# mount_cert_with_sh
A shell script to help Android root devices mount user certifications. 

The entire processes need not be executed by flushing the Magisk/KernelSU module, so there's no need to worry about module inspection tools like: momo, Memory Detector, and etc. Theoretically :>

**Last but not least: The vast majority of the code is referenced from: [httptoolkit-server](https://github.com/httptoolkit/httptoolkit-server), it's a really great program.**
